## Feature Comparison

| Feature | TypeScript | Go | Python |
|---------|------------|-----|--------|
| Type Safety | Full | Full | Type hints |
| Async Support | Native | Context | asyncio |
| Streaming | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Auto-retry | Yes | Yes | Yes |

## Core Concepts

All SDKs follow the same patterns:

1. **Initialize client** with API key
2. **Call methods** that map to API endpoints
3. **Handle responses** with typed data

## REST API

Don't see your language? The REST API is simple to use directly:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.refyne.uk/api/v1/extract \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"url": "...", "schema": {...}}'
```

See the [API Reference](/docs/api-reference) for full endpoint documentation.
