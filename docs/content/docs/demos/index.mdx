# App Demos

See Refyne in action with these example applications. Each demo showcases different use cases and integration patterns.

<Cards>
  <Card title="Recipe App" href="/docs/demos/recipe-app">
    Uses **synchronous extraction** via direct API calls. Best for quick, single-page extractions where you can wait for the response.
  </Card>
  <Card title="DIY Viewer" href="/docs/demos/diy-viewer">
    Uses the **refyne-sdk** with **async crawler operations**. Best for longer extractions with progress feedback and polling.
  </Card>
</Cards>

## Integration Patterns

Both demos use the official `refyne-sdk` TypeScript SDK but showcase different extraction patterns:

| Pattern | Demo | Best For |
|---------|------|----------|
| **Sync Extract** | Recipe App | Quick extractions, simple pages, when you can block on the response |
| **Async Crawler** | DIY Viewer | Complex pages, longer processing, progress indicators, background jobs |

Both patterns extract photos relevant to the content (recipe steps, tutorial images) using smart filtering in the schema.

## Building Your Own

These demos are open source and available in the [refyne-demos](https://github.com/jmylchreest/refyne-demos) repository. Use them as starting points for your own integrations.

Each demo includes:
- Complete source code
- Schema definitions for extraction
- API integration patterns
- Error handling examples
