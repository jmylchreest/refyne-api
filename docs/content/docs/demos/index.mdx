# App Demos

See Refyne in action with these example applications. Each demo showcases different use cases and integration patterns.

<Cards>
  <Card title="Recipe App" href="/docs/demos/recipe-app">
    Uses **synchronous extraction** via direct API calls. Best for quick, single-page extractions where you can wait for the response.
  </Card>
  <Card title="DIY Viewer" href="/docs/demos/diy-viewer">
    Uses the **@refyne/sdk** with **async crawler operations**. Best for longer extractions with progress feedback and polling.
  </Card>
</Cards>

## Integration Patterns

The two demos showcase different ways to integrate with Refyne:

| Pattern | Demo | Best For |
|---------|------|----------|
| **Sync Extract** | Recipe App | Quick extractions, simple pages, when you can block on the response |
| **Async Crawler** | DIY Viewer | Complex pages, longer processing, progress indicators, background jobs |
