This guide will help you make your first API call to <Refyne />.

## 1. Get Your API Key

Sign up at [refyne.uk](https://refyne.uk) and create an API key from your [dashboard](/dashboard/keys).

## 2. Make Your First Request

### Using a Schema

Extract data from any webpage by defining a schema:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.refyne.uk/api/v1/extract \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "url": "https://demo.refyne.uk/products/5",
    "schema": {
      "name": "string",
      "brand": "string",
      "price": "number",
      "in_stock": "boolean"
    }
  }'
```

### Using a Prompt

Alternatively, describe what you want in natural language:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.refyne.uk/api/v1/extract \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "url": "https://demo.refyne.uk/products/5",
    "schema": "Extract the product name, brand, price, and whether it is in stock"
  }'
```

## 3. Get Structured Data

<Refyne /> returns clean JSON matching your schema or prompt:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "product_name": "Red Nail Polish",
    "brand": "Nail Couture",
    "price": 8.99,
    "in_stock": true
  },
  "url": "https://demo.refyne.uk/products/5",
  "usage": {
    "input_tokens": 885,
    "output_tokens": 40
  }
}
```
