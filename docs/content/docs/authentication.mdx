description: How to authenticate with the Refyne API
---

All API requests require authentication using an API key.

## Getting an API Key

1. Sign in to your [<Refyne /> Dashboard](/dashboard/keys)
2. Navigate to **API Keys** (or use the link above)
3. Click **Create New Key**
4. Copy your key - it will only be shown once

## Using Your API Key

Include your API key in the `Authorization` header:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.refyne.uk/api/v1/extract \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer rf_your_api_key_here" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{ ... }'
```

## API Key Scopes

API keys can have different scopes:

| Scope | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `extract` | Single page extraction |
| `crawl` | Multi-page crawling |
| `analyze` | Site analysis |
| `schemas` | Schema management |

## Security Best Practices

- Never commit API keys to version control
- Use environment variables to store keys
- Rotate keys periodically
- Use the minimum required scopes

## Rate Limits

Rate limits depend on your subscription tier. See [Plans & Limits](/docs/plans-limits) for full details.

When you exceed a rate limit, the API returns HTTP 429 (Too Many Requests) with details about the limit and when you can retry.
